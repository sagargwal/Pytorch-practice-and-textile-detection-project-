# Pytorch Learning 
## 5 Key Things I Learned:
Creating custom datasets using torch.utils.data.Dataset and loading them efficiently with DataLoader

Writing my own neural network model class using nn.Module

Implementing a custom training loop with flexibility in loss functions and optimizers

Structuring projects with prediction and evaluation functions for real-world use

Understanding how data moves through layers, and how PyTorch handles autograd and backpropagation

## üéØ Applying What I Learned:
I applied this knowledge to build a Textile Defect Detection model using microscopic image data from Kaggle:
üîó https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/belkhirnacim/textiledefectdetection

Trained a deep learning model on textile defect images using PyTorch

Created a Flask backend for inference

Designed a Streamlit frontend for user interaction

Deployed the entire app for free on Hugging Face Spaces üåê
# Textile Defect Detection with PyTorch

**A deep learning model for detecting textile defects using microscopic images.**

This repository contains a deep learning model built with **PyTorch** to classify textile defects from images. The model was trained on a dataset of microscopic textile images, and the entire application has been deployed as a web app using **Flask** (backend) and **Streamlit** (frontend). The app is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** for public access.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: A ResNet50 model fine-tuned on textile defect data.
- **Backend**: Flask API for inference.
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web app to interact with the model and see predictions.
- **Deployment**: Hosted for free on Hugging Face Spaces.

## üì¶ Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6+
- **PyTorch**: For training and inference
- **Flask**: Backend to serve the model
- **Streamlit**: Frontend for interacting with the model
- **Other dependencies**: Requests, Pillow, numpy

## Install Dependencies
To install all the dependencies, use the following:
```bash
pip install requesment.txt
```


# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Usage

## 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/textile-defect-detection.git
cd textile-defect-detection
```
2. Model Setup
The model model_fold1.pth was trained using the Textile Defect Dataset from Kaggle.

To run the app locally, make sure the model file (model_fold1.pth) is present in the root directory.

3. Running the Backend (Flask API)
Run the Flask backend to expose the model for predictions:

```bash
python main.py
```
The API will be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

4. Running the Frontend (Streamlit)
Run the Streamlit app to interact with the model via the web interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will open a new tab in your browser where you can upload images and see predictions.
